Alternate transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.",
        "answer": "Answer: The gene associated with SNP rs1396355441 is PTPRB (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type B). This gene encodes a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, which are signaling molecules that regulate various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. The encoded protein is a receptor-type PTP with an extracellular domain containing multiple fibronectin type III repeats, a single transmembrane segment, and one intracytoplasmic catalytic domain. It interacts with neuronal receptors and cell adhesion molecules like contactin and tenascin C, as well as sodium channels, suggesting roles in cell adhesion, neurite growth, and neuronal differentiation."

The encoded protein is a transmembrane protein which is thought to transport small molecules and since this protein is conserved among several species, it is suggested to have a fundamental role in mammalian systems. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.",

This gene is a member of the intermediate filament family, which are proteins that are primordial components of the cytoskeleton and nuclear envelope. The protein encoded by this gene has a central rod domain similar to other members of the intermediate filament family but has limited sequence homology with them, except for this conserved region. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. It is also known as a non-homologous end joining factor IFFO1 (NHEJ factor IFFO1)."

        "ground_truth": "This gene encodes a component of the mediator complex (also known as TRAP, SMCC, DRIP, or ARC), a transcriptional coactivator complex thought to be required for the expression of almost all genes. The mediator complex is recruited by transcriptional activators or nuclear receptors to induce gene expression, possibly by interacting with RNA polymerase II and promoting the formation of a transcriptional pre-initiation complex. The product of this gene is proposed to form a sub-complex with MED12, cyclin C, and CDK8 that can negatively regulate transactivation by mediator.",
