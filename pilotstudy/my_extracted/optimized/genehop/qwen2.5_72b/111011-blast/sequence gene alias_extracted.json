        "answer": "It seems that the sequence provided does not match any known genes in the NCBI Gene database. This could mean that the sequence is either a non-coding region, a unique sequence not yet annotated, or there might be an error in the sequence itself.\n\nSince we did not find any matches using both BLAST and the EUtils API, it's likely that this sequence does not correspond to a known gene with aliases. \n\nAnswer: No significant matches found for the provided sequence. The sequence may be unique, non-coding, or not yet annotated in the NCBI databases."
