        "answer": "Answer: No specific gene record found directly for \"Hemolytic anemia due to phosphofructokinase deficiency\" using the provided query. However, based on medical knowledge, hemolytic anemia due to phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency is typically associated with mutations in the *PK* gene, which encodes phosphofructokinase. This condition is also known as Tarui disease. For precise information from NCBI databases, a more specific search term or approach might be required."

        "answer": "Answer: Gnmt\n\nIt seems there was a mix-up in the response, as it provided information related to another gene (GJB5) instead of genes associated with Glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency. The correct gene symbol for Glycine N-methyltransferase is \"Gnmt\". No further API calls are needed since the question asked for the gene related to Glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency, and Gnmt is the official gene symbol for this enzyme."
