This SNP is located on chromosome 8 at position 126,686,174 in the human genome. Here's a breakdown of some key information from the provided data:\n\n### General Information\n- **SNP_ID**: rs555675816\n- **Chromosome (CHR)**: 8\n- **Position (CHRPOS)**: 126,686,174\n\n### Allele Frequencies\nThe allele frequencies for this SNP are provided from different studies:\n- **1000Genomes**: A=0.001562/8\n- **GnomAD**: A=0.002113/296\n- **ALFA**: C=0./0 (indicating no data)\n\n### Functional Classification\nThe SNP is classified as:\n- `intron_variant`: This indicates that the variant occurs within an intron of a gene.\n- `genic_downstream_transcript_variant`\n- `genic_upstream_transcript_variant`\n\nThese classifications suggest that the SNP may affect regions near genes but not necessarily coding sequences.\n\n### Gene Association\nThe SNP is associated with:\n- **Gene**: LOC105375751 (gene ID: 105375751)\n\n### Clinical Significance and Validation\n- **CLINICAL_SIGNIFICANCE**: Not specified in the provided data.\n- **VALIDATED**: by-frequency, by-alfa, by-cluster\n\nThis indicates that the SNP has been validated through frequency analysis, ALFA (a method for identifying functional SNPs), and clustering methods.\n\n### Additional Metadata\n- **Created Date**: 2014/08/21\n- **Updated Date**: 2022/10/16\n\nThis information provides a snapshot of the SNP's characteristics and its potential impact on gene function. However, without specific clinical significance data, it is difficult to determine how this SNP might affect health or disease.\n\nIf you need more detailed analysis or have specific questions about how this SNP might relate to certain diseases or conditions, please provide additional context or specify your query!"
