            "answer": "Based on the information provided, **ATP5F1EP2** is classified as a pseudogene. Specifically, it is described as \"ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon pseudogene 2.\" Pseudogenes are generally non-functional sequences of DNA that resemble functional genes but do not produce functional proteins.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Description**: ATP5F1EP2 is an ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon pseudogene.\n- **Location**: It is located on chromosome 13 at the position 13q12.2.\n- **Function**: While it is predicted to have certain activities (e.g., hydrolase activity, proton-transporting ATP synthase activity), it is not a functional gene and does not produce a protein.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**ATP5F1EP2 is not a protein-coding gene; it is a pseudogene.**"
