        "What is the function of the gene associated with SNP rs552952471? Let's decompose the question to sub-questions and solve them step by step.": "This gene encodes retinoic acid receptor beta, a member of the thyroid-steroid hormone receptor superfamily of nuclear transcriptional regulators. This receptor localizes to the cytoplasm and to subnuclear compartments. It binds retinoic acid, the biologically active form of vitamin A which mediates cellular signalling in embryonic morphogenesis, cell growth and differentiation. It is thought that this protein limits growth of many cell types by regulating gene expression. The gene was first identified in a hepatocellular carcinoma where it flanks a hepatitis B virus integration site. Alternate promoter usage and differential splicing result in multiple transcript variants.",

        "What is the function of the gene associated with SNP rs1199372758? Let's decompose the question to sub-questions and solve them step by step.": "The protein encoded by this gene is a negative regulator of autophagy and endocytic trafficking and controls endosome maturation. This protein contains two conserved domains, an N-terminal RUN domain and a C-terminal DUF4206 domain. The RUN domain is involved in Ras-like GTPase signaling, and the DUF4206 domain contains a diacylglycerol (DAG) binding-like motif. Mutation in this gene results in deletion of the DAG binding-like motif and causes a recessive ataxia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.",
        "What is the function of the gene associated with SNP rs1396355441? Let's decompose the question to sub-questions and solve them step by step.": "The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP contains an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment and one intracytoplasmic catalytic domain, thus belongs to receptor type PTP. The extracellular region of this PTP is composed of multiple fibronectin type_III repeats, which was shown to interact with neuronal receptor and cell adhesion molecules, such as contactin and tenascin C. This protein was also found to interact with sodium channels, and thus may regulate sodium channels by altering tyrosine phosphorylation status. The functions of the interaction partners of this protein implicate the roles of this PTP in cell adhesion, neurite growth, and neuronal differentiation. Alternate transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.",

It is located in a gene cluster with another member of the family, organic cation transporter like 3. The encoded protein is a transmembrane protein which is thought to transport small molecules and since this protein is conserved among several species, it is suggested to have a fundamental role in mammalian systems. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.",
        "What is the function of the gene associated with SNP rs937944577? Let's decompose the question to sub-questions and solve them step by step.": "This gene is a member of the intermediate filament family. Intermediate filaments are proteins which are primordial components of the cytoskeleton and nuclear envelope. The proteins encoded by the members of this gene family are evolutionarily and structurally related but have limited sequence homology, with the exception of the central rod domain. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.",
        "What is the function of the gene associated with SNP rs1450106117? Let's decompose the question to sub-questions and solve them step by step.": "This gene encodes a component of the mediator complex (also known as TRAP, SMCC, DRIP, or ARC), a transcriptional coactivator complex thought to be required for the expression of almost all genes. The mediator complex is recruited by transcriptional activators or nuclear receptors to induce gene expression, possibly by interacting with RNA polymerase II and promoting the formation of a transcriptional pre-initiation complex. The product of this gene is proposed to form a sub-complex with MED12, cyclin C, and CDK8 that can negatively regulate transactivation by mediator.",
