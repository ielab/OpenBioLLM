Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.",
        "answer": "Answer: The gene associated with SNP rs937944577 is IFFO1, which encodes a member of the intermediate filament family. Intermediate filaments are proteins that serve as primordial components of the cytoskeleton and nuclear envelope. This particular gene has limited sequence homology to other members of its family except for the central rod domain. It plays a role in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) factor processes, which is crucial for DNA repair mechanisms."

        "ground_truth": "This gene encodes a component of the mediator complex (also known as TRAP, SMCC, DRIP, or ARC), a transcriptional coactivator complex thought to be required for the expression of almost all genes. The mediator complex is recruited by transcriptional activators or nuclear receptors to induce gene expression, possibly by interacting with RNA polymerase II and promoting the formation of a transcriptional pre-initiation complex. The product of this gene is proposed to form a sub-complex with MED12, cyclin C, and CDK8 that can negatively regulate transactivation by mediator.",
        "answer": "Answer: The gene associated with SNP rs1450106117 is MED13, which encodes a component of the mediator complex. This complex acts as a transcriptional coactivator and is required for the expression of almost all genes. Specifically, it can be recruited by transcriptional activators or nuclear receptors to induce gene expression through interaction with RNA polymerase II and promotion of the formation of a transcriptional pre-initiation complex. The MED13 product forms a sub-complex with other proteins that can negatively regulate transactivation by mediator."

        "ground_truth": "This gene encodes an essential regulator of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake under basal conditions. The encoded protein interacts with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, a mitochondrial inner membrane Ca2+ channel, and is essential in preventing mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, which can cause excessive production of reactive oxygen species and cell stress. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.",
        "answer": "Answer: The gene associated with SNP rs34083046 is MICU1, which encodes an essential regulator of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake under basal conditions. This protein interacts with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter and prevents mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, thereby avoiding excessive production of reactive oxygen species and cell stress."

        "answer": "Answer: The gene associated with SNP rs149916046 is LINC02841, which is described as a long intergenic non-protein coding RNA. Based on the information retrieved, there is no detailed functional description provided for this specific gene in the NCBI Gene database entry. Therefore, we can conclude that LINC02841 is involved in non-coding RNA functions, but more specific details about its role are not available from the current data."
