        "answer": "Based on the information provided, **ATP5F1EP2** is a pseudogene and not a protein-coding gene. Specifically:\n\n- **Description**: ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon pseudogene 2.\n- **Nomenclature Name**: ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon pseudogene 2.\n- **Summary**: Predicted to enable hydrolase activity, contribute to proton-transporting ATP synthase activity, and be involved in proton motive force-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Located in mitochondrion.\n\nSince it is a pseudogene, it does not produce a functional protein. Therefore, **ATP5F1EP2** is not a protein-coding gene."
