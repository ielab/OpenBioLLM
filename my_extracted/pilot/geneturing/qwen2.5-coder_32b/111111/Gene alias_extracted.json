        "answer": "The official gene symbol for the gene previously known as QSCN6L1 is **QSOX2** in humans (Homo sapiens). This gene encodes a member of the sulfhydryl oxidase/quiescin-6 (Q6) family and plays a role in regulating neuroblastoma cell sensitivity to IFN-gamma-induced cell death. The other entries listed are either for different species or have been discontinued by NCBI. Therefore, the official human gene symbol is **QSOX2**."
