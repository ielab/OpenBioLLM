This protein was also found to interact with sodium channels, and thus may regulate sodium channels by altering tyrosine phosphorylation status. The functions of the interaction partners of this protein implicate the roles of this PTP in cell adhesion, neurite growth, and neuronal differentiation. Alternate transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.",
    "answer": "The SNP rs1396355441 is located in the gene PTPRB (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type B). The function of this gene involves encoding a protein that belongs to the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. This protein regulates cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and neuronal functions by altering the phosphorylation status of sodium channels and interacting with various molecules involved in cell adhesion and neurite growth."

    "ground_truth": "This gene encodes a member of the organic-cation transporter family. It is located in a gene cluster with another member of the family, organic cation transporter like 3. The encoded protein is a transmembrane protein which is thought to transport small molecules and since this protein is conserved among several species, it is suggested to have a fundamental role in mammalian systems. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.",
    "answer": "The SNP rs1432624213 is located in the SLC22A14 gene on chromosome 3 at position p22.2. The SLC22A14 gene encodes a protein known as solute carrier family 22 member 14, which functions as an organic cation transporter-like protein (OCTL4). This protein is involved in the transport of certain organic cations across cell membranes. However, the specific functional impact of the SNP rs1432624213 on SLC22A14 has not been detailed in the provided information and would require further investigation to determine its potential effect on gene expression or protein function."

    "ground_truth": "This gene is a member of the intermediate filament family. Intermediate filaments are proteins which are primordial components of the cytoskeleton and nuclear envelope. The proteins encoded by the members of this gene family are evolutionarily and structurally related but have limited sequence homology, with the exception of the central rod domain. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.",
    "answer": "The SNP rs937944577 is located in the intron of the gene IFFO1 (intermediate filament family orphan 1). The function of IFFO1 is not fully characterized, but it belongs to the intermediate filament family and is involved in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a process that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. This suggests that IFFO1 may play a role in maintaining genomic stability."

    "ground_truth": "This gene encodes a component of the mediator complex (also known as TRAP, SMCC, DRIP, or ARC), a transcriptional coactivator complex thought to be required for the expression of almost all genes. The mediator complex is recruited by transcriptional activators or nuclear receptors to induce gene expression, possibly by interacting with RNA polymerase II and promoting the formation of a transcriptional pre-initiation complex. The product of this gene is proposed to form a sub-complex with MED12, cyclin C, and CDK8 that can negatively regulate transactivation by mediator.",
    "answer": "The SNP rs1450106117 is located in the gene MED13 on chromosome 17. The MED13 gene encodes a component of the mediator complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation by interacting with RNA polymerase II and promoting the formation of a transcriptional pre-initiation complex. This suggests that rs1450106117 may affect the function or expression of MED13, potentially influencing transcriptional processes in cells. However, specific functional consequences of this SNP have not been detailed in the provided information."
