Specifically:\n\n- **Description**: ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon pseudogene 2.\n- **Nomenclature Name**: ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon pseudogene 2.\n- **Summary**: Predicted to enable hydrolase activity, contribute to proton-transporting ATP synthase activity, and be involved in proton motive force-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Located in mitochondrion.\n\nSince it is a pseudogene, it does not produce a functional protein. Therefore, **ATP5F1EP2** is not a protein-coding gene.",

Some of the key genes include:\n\n- **ADA** (Adenosine Deaminase): Associated with SCID due to adenosine deaminase deficiency.\n- **IL2RG** (Interleukin 2 Receptor Subunit Gamma): Associated with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDX1).\n- **RAG1 and RAG2**: Involved in the recombination activating genes, which are crucial for B-cell development.\n- **BTK** (Bruton Tyrosine Kinase): Defects in this gene can lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a form of B-cell immunodeficiency.\n\nFor a more detailed list and specific conditions, the following OMIM entries provide additional information:\n\n- 616084: Sideroblastic anemia with B-cell immunodeficiency, periodic fevers, and developmental delay (SIFD)\n- 600802: Severe combined immunodeficiency, autosomal recessive, T cell-negative, B cell-positive, NK cell-negative\n- 619924: Immunodeficiency 105, severe combined (IMD105)\n- 615617: Immunodeficiency 19, severe combined (IMD19)\n- 617237: Immunodeficiency 49, severe combined (IMD49)\n- 611291: Immunodeficiency 124, severe combined (IMD124)\n- 615607: Immunodeficiency 17 (IMD17)\n- 608971: Immunodeficiency 104, severe combined (IMD104)\n- 602450: Severe combined immunodeficiency with sensitivity to ionizing radiation\n- 609296: B-cell immunodeficiency, distal limb anomalies, and urogenital malformations (BILU)\n- 102700: Severe combined immunodeficiency, autosomal recessive, T cell-negative, B cell-negative, NK cell-negative, due to adenosine deaminase deficiency\n- 601457: Severe combined immunodeficiency, autosomal recessive, T cell-negative, B cell-negative, NK cell-positive\n- 300400: Severe combined immunodeficiency, X-linked (SCIDX1)\n- 615615: Immunodeficiency 18 (IMD18)\n- 300113: X-linked B cell surface antigen, mouse, homolog-like 1 (XLRL)\n- 614868: Immunodeficiency 110 with lymphoproliferation (IMD110)\n- 617765: Immunodeficiency, common variable, 14 (CVID14)\n- 615206: Immunodeficiency 11A (IMD11A)\n- 610163: Immunodeficiency 25 (IMD25)\n- 620668: Immunodeficiency 117 (IMD117)",

The results show multiple alignments with high identity scores, indicating strong similarity between your query sequence and the sequences in these BAC clones.\n\nHere's a summary of the key points:\n\n### Query Sequence\n- **Query Length**: 120 nucleotides\n\n### BAC Clones Analyzed\n1. **AL590841.13 (Homo sapiens)**\n   - **Length**: 167,802 bp\n   - **Alignments**:\n     - Multiple alignments with high identity scores (e.g., 195 bits, 105/120 identities)\n     - Alignments on both plus and minus strands\n\n2. **AC147391.6 (Homo sapiens)**\n   - **Length**: 262,955 bp\n   - **Alignments**:\n     - Multiple alignments with high identity scores (e.g., 195 bits, 105/120 identities)\n     - Alignments on both plus and minus strands\n\n3. **AC147391.6 (Homo sapiens)**\n   - **Length**: 262,955 bp\n   - **Alignments**:\n     - Multiple alignments with high identity scores (e.g., 195 bits, 105/120 identities)\n     - Alignments on both plus and minus strands\n\n4. **AC186373.3 (Pan troglodytes)**\n   - **Length**: 157,565 bp\n   - **Alignments**:\n     - Multiple alignments with high identity scores (e.g., 195 bits, 105/120 identities)\n     - Alignments on both plus and minus strands\n\n5. **AC186373.3 (Pan troglodytes)**\n   - **Length**: 157,565 bp\n   - **Alignments**:\n     - Multiple alignments with high identity scores (e.g., 195 bits, 105/120 identities)\n     - Alignments on both plus and minus strands\n\n### Summary of Key Alignments\n- **High Identity Scores**: Most alignments have very high identity scores, indicating strong sequence similarity.\n- **Strand Specificity**: Alignments are found on both the plus and minus strands, suggesting that the query sequence is conserved in both orientations.\n- **Conservation Across Species**: The query sequence shows high conservation between human and chimpanzee BAC clones, which is expected given their close evolutionary relationship.\n\n### Example Alignment\nHere's an example of a high-scoring alignment from one of the BAC clones:\n\n#### AC147391.6 (Homo sapiens)\n- **Query**: `TTTCCACGATAGACCTGAAACTGCCTAAATATATCTCTTTGCAGATTCTACAAAAAGACT`\n- **Subject**: `TTTTCACGATAGACCTGAAAATGCCTACATATATCCCTTTGCAGATTCTACAAAAAGACT`\n- **Score**: 195 bits\n- **Identity**: 105/120 (87.5%)\n\n### Conclusion\nThe BLAST results indicate that your query sequence is highly conserved and has multiple strong alignments with the BAC clones from both human and chimpanzee genomes. This suggests that the sequence is likely to be functionally important or evolutionarily conserved.\n\nIf you have specific questions about any of the alignments or need further analysis, feel free to ask!",

The high identity scores and low E-values suggest that your sequence is likely derived from these regions of the human genome. If you need further analysis, such as functional annotation or specific gene identification, you might want to explore the genomic context of these alignments using tools like UCSC Genome Browser or Ensembl.",

        "answer": "It seems that the exact gene name \"RP11-255A11.4\" is not returning a specific match in the human gene database, even with additional context and chromosome location. However, based on the results from the search for genes related to RP11 and Homo sapiens chromosome 19, we can infer that the gene \"RP11-255A11.4\" might be one of these genes or closely related.\n\nGiven the information provided, let's focus on the most relevant result:\n\n**PRPF31 (Gene ID: 26121)**\n- Chromosome: 19\n- Location: 19q13.42\n\nSince \"RP11-255A11.4\" is not explicitly listed, it might be an alias or a closely related gene to PRPF31. However, without more specific information, we can conclude that the gene \"RP11-255A11.4\" is likely located on chromosome 19.\n\nAnswer: Chromosome 19",
