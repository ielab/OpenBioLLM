These proteins play roles in various cellular functions such as cytokinesis and vesicle trafficking.\n\nThe specific SNP rs1481036795 is classified as an intron variant, meaning it occurs within an intron (non-coding region) of the SEPTIN11 gene and does not directly alter the coding sequence. Therefore, its functional impact on the protein or cellular processes may be limited compared to variants that affect the coding regions.\n\nIn summary, the SEPTIN11 gene is involved in cytokinesis and vesicle trafficking, but rs1481036795 itself is an intron variant with no direct effect on the encoded protein.",
