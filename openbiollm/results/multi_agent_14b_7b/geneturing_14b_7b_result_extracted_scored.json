Therefore, the specific gene of interest for Hemolytic Anemia due to Phosphofructokinase deficiency would be **PFKM** or **PFKL**, depending on the tissue type affected.\n\nFor more detailed information about these genes and their association with phosphofructokinase deficiency, you may want to consult OMIM entries directly related to PFKM (613085) or PFKL (172940).",
