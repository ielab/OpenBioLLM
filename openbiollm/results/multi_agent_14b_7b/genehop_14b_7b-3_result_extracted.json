    "ground_truth": "This gene encodes a component of the mediator complex (also known as TRAP, SMCC, DRIP, or ARC), a transcriptional coactivator complex thought to be required for the expression of almost all genes. The mediator complex is recruited by transcriptional activators or nuclear receptors to induce gene expression, possibly by interacting with RNA polymerase II and promoting the formation of a transcriptional pre-initiation complex. The product of this gene is proposed to form a sub-complex with MED12, cyclin C, and CDK8 that can negatively regulate transactivation by mediator.",
    "answer": "The SNP rs1450106117 is located in the gene MED13 on chromosome 17. The MED13 gene encodes a component of the mediator complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation by interacting with RNA polymerase II and promoting the formation of a transcriptional pre-initiation complex. This suggests that rs1450106117 may affect the function or expression of MED13, potentially influencing transcriptional processes in cells. However, specific functional consequences of this SNP have not been detailed in the provided information."

    "question": "What is the function of the gene associated with SNP rs34083046? Let's decompose the question to sub-questions and solve them step by step.",
    "ground_truth": "This gene encodes an essential regulator of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake under basal conditions. The encoded protein interacts with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, a mitochondrial inner membrane Ca2+ channel, and is essential in preventing mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, which can cause excessive production of reactive oxygen species and cell stress. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.",
    "answer": "The SNP rs34083046 is located in the intron of the gene MICU1 on chromosome 10. The MICU1 gene encodes a protein called mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MCU1), which plays a role in regulating calcium levels within mitochondria."

    "ground_truth": "ncRNA",
    "answer": "The SNP rs149916046 is located in the intron of the gene LINC02841 on chromosome 19. LINC02841 is a long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, which means it does not encode for proteins but may have regulatory functions at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. However, specific functional details about this SNP and its impact are not provided in the available data."

    "question": "What is the function of the gene associated with SNP rs1385096481? Let's decompose the question to sub-questions and solve them step by step.",
    "ground_truth": "This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain-containing family of proteins. A similar protein in mouse, a glycosylated transmembrane protein, is thought to function in presynaptic differentiation.",
    "answer": "The SNP rs1385096481 is located in the intron of the gene LRFN5 (leucine rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 5). The function of LRFN5 specifically related to this SNP cannot be directly inferred from the information provided, as SNPs within introns do not typically alter protein sequences. However, it may affect splicing or regulatory elements that influence gene expression. For a precise functional impact, further experimental studies would be necessary."
